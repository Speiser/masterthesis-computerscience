## Abstract
> It is a common trend for organizations to migrate their software systems from a monolithic architecture to a microservice architecture, which usually starts without any experience of the microservice architecture. As with any other technology, microservice architectures have various patterns and anti patterns. Furthermore, it is hard to keep track of the regularly occurring decay of a software architecture. Existing tools often require an immense configuration effort in advance and are not specialized in detecting a taxonomy of microservice specific anti patterns. Therefore a prototype is implemented to automatically detect a specified set of microservice related anti patterns in C# projects. In addition, a list of open source projects, implementing the microservice architecture, is considered and compiled. Furthermore, within the context of a case study, this list of projects is then analyzed by the built prototype. Based on the outcome of the analysis one open source project is proposed as an advantageous guideline for the implementation of a microservice project. Additionally, as a key result the *API Versioning*, *Hardcoded Endpoints*, *Lack of Monitoring* and *Shared Libraries* anti patterns were identified as most frequently occurring pitfalls in microservice projects in particular.
